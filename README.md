# TVC_control_PID
Created a PID controller class in Python to control a TVC rocket in a simulated environment.
Developed a Physics Engine for rocket dynamics, plotted data using Matplotlib and visual feedback using Turtle.
Determined the PID Gain values using Ziegler-Nichols tuning method as a starting point.
